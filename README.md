# Juice Shopping Cart

## Project Description
The **Juice Shopping Cart** is a simple web-based system that allows users to add juice products to a shopping cart, view the cart, apply discounts or free shipping, and calculate the total price. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates basic e-commerce functionality in a responsive interface.

## How to Run the System
 **Open in a Browser**:
   - After downloading or cloning the repository, open the `juice.html` file in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to use the shopping cart system.

## Features:
- **Product List**: Displays various juice products that can be added to the cart.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add and remove items, increase or decrease quantities, and view the total.
- **Discounts & Free Shipping**: The system applies a 10% discount or free shipping based on the number of items in the cart.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Instructions:
1. Click on "Add to Cart" buttons to add products to the shopping cart.
2. View the **Cart** section to see the selected products, their quantities, and the total.
3. You can apply a **10% Discount** or **Free Shipping** if there are 2 or more products in the cart.
4. The **Total Price** will update automatically as products are added or removed.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Markup language to structure the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling for the page layout and product display.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for managing the cart, updating totals, and handling user interactions.

## How the Code Works:
1. **Product Class**: Handles individual product details like name, price, image, and quantity.
2. **Cart Class**: Manages the cart, adding/removing products, updating totals, and applying discounts.
3. **Decorator Pattern**: Used to apply optional features like discounts and free shipping dynamically.
4. **Observer Pattern**: Ensures the UI is updated automatically whenever the cart changes (e.g., items added, quantities updated).
